Let a man observe that new-moon day (amāvāsyā) as a day of abstinence, on which the moon is not seen.

#####  Commentary

This Sūtra has to be connected with Sūtra LXV. The abstinence takes place on the day, if the actual new moon, the nearest approach of sun and moon, falls on the afternoon, at night, or at twilight. And this new moon, the junction of the fifteenth day and the pratipad, is called Kuhū. We should read amāvāsyām.
