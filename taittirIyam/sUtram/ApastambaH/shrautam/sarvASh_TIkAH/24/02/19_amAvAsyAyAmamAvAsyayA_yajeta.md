Let a man sacrifice with the Amāvāsyā sacrifice at the time of the Amāvāsyā, new moon.

#####  Commentary

Amā-vāsyā is the dwelling together, i.e. the conjunction, of sun and moon, an astronomical expression which was adopted in the common language of the people at a very early time. It does not occur, however, in the Ṛg-veda. In our Sūtra amāvāsyā is used in the sense both of new moon and new-moon sacrifice.
