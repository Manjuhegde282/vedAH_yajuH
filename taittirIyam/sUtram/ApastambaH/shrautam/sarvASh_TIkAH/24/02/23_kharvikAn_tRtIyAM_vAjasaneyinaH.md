The Vājasaneyins mention a third, the Kharvikā full moon.

#####  Commentary

Kharva means small. If one divides the night into twelve parts, and if in a portion of the twelfth part the greatest distance of sun and moon takes place, then the full moon is called kharvikā, also kṣīṇā. 

Or, if on the sixteenth day, the full moon takes place before noon, that also is called kharvikā paurṇamāsī. In that case abstinence or fasting takes place on the sixteenth day (tasyāṃ ṣoḍaśe’hany upavāsaḥ). Both paurṇamāsīs are also called sadyaskālā.
