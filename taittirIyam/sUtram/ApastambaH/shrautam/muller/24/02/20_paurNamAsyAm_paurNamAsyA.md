And let a man sacrifice with the Paurṇamāsyā sacrifice at the time of the Paurṇamāsī, full moon, thus it is said.

#####  Commentary

Here the full moon is called paurṇamāsī, the sacrifice paurṇamāsyā. Satyavrata joins the two Sūtras in one, and leaves out yajeteti, which may have belonged to the commentary.
