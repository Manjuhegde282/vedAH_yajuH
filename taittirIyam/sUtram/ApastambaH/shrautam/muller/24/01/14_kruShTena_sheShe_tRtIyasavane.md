[^2]:  See on this, Ṛg-veda Prātiśākhya 13, 17; Āśval. I, 5, 27; Sāṅkh. I, 14; Hillebrandt, l.c. p. 103.

#####  Commentary

The remainder refers to the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice, the three Savanas to the Soma sacrifice. Satyavrata takes all these rules as referring to the cases mentioned in Sūtra X.
