In the Sāmidhenī hymns the recitation is to be between (the high and the low tone).

## १ Commentary

The Sāmidhenīs are the hymns used for lighting the fire. One commentator explains antarā, between, as between high tone (kruṣṭa) and the murmuring (upāṃśu). Another distinguishes three high tones, the kruṣṭa (also called tāra or krauñca), the madhyama, and the mandra, and assigns the madhyama to the Sāmidhenī hymns. The mandra notes come from the chest, the madhyama notes from the throat, the uttama notes from the head.
