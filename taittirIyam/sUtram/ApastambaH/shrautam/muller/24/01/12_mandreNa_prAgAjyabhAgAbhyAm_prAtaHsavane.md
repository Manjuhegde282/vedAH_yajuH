Before the Ājyabhāgas (such as the Ājya-portions at the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa), and at the morning Savana (oblation of Soma), the recitation is to be with the soft (mandra) voice.

#####  Commentary

The pronunciation is loud, uccaiḥ, but soft, mandra. Satyavrata restricts this rule to the passages mentioned in Sūtra X. He also treats the second part of Sūtras XII, XIII, and XIV as separate Sūtras.
