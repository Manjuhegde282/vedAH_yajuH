For all sacrifices the fires are laid once.

#####  Commentary

The sacrificial fires have to be arranged for the first time by a peculiar ceremony, called the Agnyādhāna. They are generally three (Tretā), the Gārhapatya, the father; the Dakṣiṇa, the son; and the Āhavanīya, the grandson. The first laying of the Gārhapatya fire-altar takes place in spring for a Brāhmaṇa, in summer for a Rājanya, in winter for a Vaiśya.
