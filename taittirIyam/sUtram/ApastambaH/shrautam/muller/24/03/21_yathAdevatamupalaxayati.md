Let the word idam be the rule.

## १ Commentary

This means that the offering (havis) intended for each deity should be pointed out by the words idam, this, Agneḥ, is for Agni, &c. Thus we read with regard to the offerings intended for certain gods and goddesses: idaṃ Dhātur, idam Anumatyā, Rākāyāḥ Sinīvālyāḥ, Kuhvāḥ.
