With āhutis one should let the act (the pouring out) take place after the Vaṣaṭkāra has been made, or while it is being made.

#####  Commentary

The Vaṣaṭkāra consists in the word Vaṣaṭ, to be uttered by the Hotṛ-priest. The five sacrificial interjections are, svāhā, srauṣaṭ, vauṣaṭ, vaṣaṭ, and svadhā.
