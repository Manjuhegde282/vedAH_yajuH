As the Prakṛti has been told before, anything that has not been told before, should be at the end.

## १ Commentary

This seems to mean that anything new, peculiar to a Vikṛti, and not mentioned in the Prakṛti, should come in at the end, that is, after those portions of the sacrifice which are enjoined in the Prakṛti.
